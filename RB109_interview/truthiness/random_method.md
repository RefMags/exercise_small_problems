```ruby
def random_method(value)
	"Truthy value!" unless value
end

if random_method(true)
	new_value = "The if branch ran"
else
	new_value = "The else branch ran"
end

p new_value
```
# Explaining the code:
In lines 1 to 3, method `randome_method` is defined by passing in a parameter `value`. Within the code, `unless` conditional statement is used to execute the code only if a given condition is false to print `Truthy value!` . If `value` is `true`, `nil` will be output.
So in line 5, `random_method` is invoked and passed `true` as an argument, which is referenced by `value` in the method definition. The code within the method is not executed because `true` returns `nil`.
In line 5 to 9, an `if..else` statement is used to evaluate the returns of the method invocation, `random_method`. In Ruby, `nil` evaluates to false, so the `else` branch is executed. The return is assigned to `new_value` variable in line 8.
when `p` method is invoked, and passed the object referenced by the output of the conditional statement, `The else branch ran` is printed to the console.
